# Python Requirements for Network Migration POC
# Only Robot Framework is needed - Go library has NO Python dependencies!

# Core testing framework
robotframework==7.0

# Optional: For enhanced reporting (not required for basic POC)
# robotframework-excellibrary==4.0.0  # If you want Excel report generation
# robotframework-metrics==3.3.3       # If you want test metrics dashboard

# Note: NO SSH libraries needed!
# The Go remote library handles all SSH connections
# This eliminates dependency issues with:
# - paramiko
# - netmiko  
# - napalm
# etc.
